    "Nothing much to say about binary search. It's a very simple and efficient algorithm. It's a `divide and conquer` algorithm. It's very efficient because it's time complexity is O(log n). It's very simple because it's very easy to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "What's divide and conquer algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "`Divide and conquer` is an algorithmic paradigm. A typical divide and conquer algorithm solves a problem using the following three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Divide**: Break the given problem into subproblems of same type.\n",
    "2. **Conquer**: Recursively solve these subproblems\n",
    "3. **Combine**: Appropriately combine the answers\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the `divide and conquer` algorithms have a time complexity of O(n log n).\n",
    "\n",
    "# <a id='toc2_'></a>[How Binary Search Works?](#toc0_)\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary search works on the principle of `divide and conquer`. To use binary search on a collection, the collection must be `sorted`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In each step, the algorithm compares the input element x with the value of the middle element in array. If the values match, return the index of middle. Otherwise, if x is less than the middle element, then the algorithm recurses on the left side of the middle element, else recurses on the right side of the middle element.\n",
    "\n",
    "I don't have any tools that might heps you visualize the binary search algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "But \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have a sorted array of 10 elements. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    [2,7,9,12,15,20,25,30,35,40]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And we want to find the position of 20.\n",
    "\n",
    "TO do that in binary search, we will first need to take a start and end pointer. The start pointer will point to the first element of the array and the end pointer will point to the last element of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    [2,7,9,12,15,20,25,30,35,40]\n",

    "We have `n` jobs, where every job is scheduled to be done from `startTime[i]` to `endTime[i]`, obtaining a profit of `profit[i]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You're given the `startTime`, `endTime` and `profit` arrays, return the maximum profit you can take such that there are no two jobs in the subset with overlapping time range.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: startTime = [1,2,3,3], endTime = [3,4,5,6], profit = [50,10,40,70]\n",

    "> I do not have enough resources to explain the problem in detail. This problem is heavy on `dynamic programming` and `binary search` and I encourage you to solve this problem on your own. Or you can watch this video to understand the problem: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLoWc3v0SiE\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a `DFS` and `binary search` problem and it's very heavy on `dynamic programming`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "import bisect\n",
    "#import zip\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class Solution:\n",
    "    def jobScheduling(self, startTime: List[int], endTime: List[int], profit: List[int]) -> int:\n",

    "        \n",
    "        return dfs(0)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what I did:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. I sorted the `startTime`, `endTime`, and `profit` arrays and zipped them together.\n",
    "2. I used the bisect module because if I try to implement the binary search algorithm, it will take a lot of time and the code will be very messy.\n",
    "3. I use memoization to store the results of the subproblems.\n",
    "4. Now I call the `dfs` function with the `startTime` array and return the result.\n",
    "5. The `dfs` function is a recursive function that takes an index `i` as an argument. It returns the maximum profit that can be obtained from the `i-th` job to the last job.\n",
    "6. If the `i-th` job is the last job, it returns 0.\n",
    "7. If the `i-th` job is already in the memo, it returns the result from the memo.\n",
    "8. It then finds the next job that can be done after the `i-th` job using the `bisect` module.\n",
    "9. It then returns the maximum profit that can be obtained from the `i-th` job to the last job.\n",
    "10. The `dfs` function is called with the `i-th` job and the result is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it. I knwo this is a very complex problem and I haven't made an article on `dynamic programming` yet and I'm still learning about it. I'll make a separate article on `dynamic programming` and i think you should solve this problem on your own.\n",
