    "\n",
    "Binary search is widely used `searching` algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a `sorted` array. It comes very frequently in coding interviews. So, it's very important to have a good understanding of this algorithm.\n",

    "So, here's everything about `Array` in python.\n",

    "Pre-requisites:\n",

    "- Basic knowledge of python\n",
    "\n",
    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Nothing much to say about binary search. It's a very simple and efficient algorithm. It's a `divide and conquer` algorithm. It's very efficient because it's time complexity is O(log n). It's very simple because it's very easy to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "What's divide and conquer algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "`Divide and conquer` is an algorithmic paradigm. A typical divide and conquer algorithm solves a problem using the following three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Divide**: Break the given problem into subproblems of same type.\n",
    "2. **Conquer**: Recursively solve these subproblems\n",
    "3. **Combine**: Appropriately combine the answers\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the `divide and conquer` algorithms have a time complexity of O(n log n).\n",
    "\n",
    "# How Binary Search Works?\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary search works on the principle of `divide and conquer`. To use binary search on a collection, the collection must be `sorted`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In each step, the algorithm compares the input element x with the value of the middle element in array. If the values match, return the index of middle. Otherwise, if x is less than the middle element, then the algorithm recurses on the left side of the middle element, else recurses on the right side of the middle element.\n",
    "\n",
    "I don't have any tools that might heps you visualize the binary search algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "But \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have a sorted array of 10 elements. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    [2,7,9,12,15,20,25,30,35,40]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And we want to find the position of 20.\n",
    "\n",
    "TO do that in binary search, we will first need to take a start and end pointer. The start pointer will point to the first element of the array and the end pointer will point to the last element of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    [2,7,9,12,15,20,25,30,35,40]\n",
    "     ^                        ^\n",
    "     |                        |\n",
    "    start                    end\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we will calculate the middle index of the array. The middle index will be the average of start and end index.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    [2,7,9,12,15,20,25,30,35,40]\n",

    "    mid = (0 + 9) // 2\n",
    "    mid = 4\n",
