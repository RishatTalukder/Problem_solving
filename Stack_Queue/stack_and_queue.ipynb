    "`Stack & Queue` are very similar `data structures`. They are both `linear data structures` meaning these `data structures` store the `items` in a `linear fashion` just like `arrays` and `linked lists`. So, as we can implement and solve `stack & queue` problems using `arrays` and `linked lists`, I will discuss the `array` and `linked list` implementation of `stack & queue` in this article.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with `stack`.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Stack\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Stack?\n",
    "\n",
    "A `stack` is a `linear data structure` that stores items in a `Last-In/First-Out (LIFO)` or `First-In/Last-Out (FILO)` manner. In stack, a new element is added at one end and an element is removed from that end only. The `insert` and `delete` operations are often called `push` and `pop`.\n",
    "\n",
    "let's take an example of a `stack of colored plates`. Assume that you have a stack of plates on your table. The first plate you put on the table is at the bottom, so it will be the last one to be used. The last plate you put on the table is at the top, so it will be the first one to be used. This is exactly how a `stack` works.\n",
    "\n",
    "here is a picture of a `stack`:\n",
    "\n",
    "![stack](https://cdn.buttercms.com/PuR6MmOQQdqAP6xfh6JO)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we start with an `empty stack`. We can `push` items onto the `stack` one by one. Each time we `push` an item, it goes on the `top` of the `stack`. When we `pop` an item off the `stack`, we always `pop` the `top` item. The `stack` is `empty` when there are no items on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, when we `push` an `item` in the `stack` it's always the last `item` and when we `pop` an `item` from the `stack` it's always the last `item` as well. This is why we call it `Last-In/First-Out (LIFO)` or `First-In/Last-Out (FILO)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although `stack` is a `static data structure` that means we have to specify the `size` of the `stack` before using it. But as we are using `arrays` and `linked lists` on `python` to implement `stack` and we can make a `dynamic stack` using `python` `list` and `linked list`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: `Stack` is a `abstract data type` and `array` and `linked list` are the `data structures` that we use to implement `stack`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*** Overflow and Underflow\n",
    "\n",
    "`Overflow` condition occurs when we try to `push` an `item` into a `stack` that is `full`. A `stack` may be `full` because of two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Either it is a `fixed size` `stack` and it is `full`.\n",
    "- Or it is a `dynamic size` `stack` and the `system memory` is `full`.\n",
    "  \n",
    "`Underflow` condition occurs when we try to `pop` an `item` from a `stack` that is `empty`. A `stack` may be `empty` because of two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Either it is a `fixed size` `stack` and it is `empty`.\n",
    "- Or it is a `dynamic size` `stack` and the `system memory` is `empty`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We, will implement a `dynamic size` `stack` using `python` `list` and `linked list` in this article. So, we don't have to worry about `overflow` and `underflow` conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stack Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "A `stack` is an `abstract data type` that supports the following operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `push`: Adds an `item` to the `stack`. If the `stack` is `full`, then it is said to be an `Overflow condition`.\n",
    "- `pop`: Removes an `item` from the `stack`. The `items` are `popped` in the `reverse order` in which they are `pushed`. If the `stack` is `empty`, then it is said to be an `Underflow condition`.\n",
    "- `peek`: Returns the `top` element of the `stack`.\n",
    "- `isEmpty`: Returns `true` if the `stack` is `empty`, else `false`.\n",
    "- `isFull`: Returns `true` if the `stack` is `full`, else `false`.(Not mendaotry for `python` implementation)\n",
    "- `size`: Returns the `size` of the `stack`. (Not mendaotry for `python` implementation)\n",
    "  \n",
    "## Stack Implementation Using Array(python list)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can implement `stack` using `array` in `python` using `list`. We will use `list` `append` and `pop` methods to implement `stack` operations. `append` method will be used to `push` an `item` into the `stack` and `pop` method will be used to `pop` an `item` from the `stack`. `peak` method will be used to get the `top` element of the `stack`, in a list the `last element` is the `top` element of the `stack`. `isEmpty` method will be used to check if the `stack` is `empty` or not, so if the `list` is `empty` then the `stack` is `empty` as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, let's `initialize` the `stack`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- we will make a class called `Stack` and initialize it with an `empty list`."

    "`Linked List` is the most basic `data structure` I have a article on `linked list` as well. You can check it out in my `github` repository or `linkedin` profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please go through the article before continuing this article. It will help you to understand the `stack` implementation using `linked list` better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's some basic knowledge of `linked list`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Linked List` is a `linear data structure` that stores `items` in a `non-contiguous` manner. Each `item` is stored in a `node`. Each `node` contains `data` and a `pointer` to the `next node`. The `first node` is called the `head` and the `last node` is called the `tail`. The `tail` points to `null` or `None` to indicate the `end of the list`.\n",
    "\n",
    "![linked list](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20220712172013/Singlelinkedlist.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if we compare `linked list` with `array` then we can see there are many similarities between them. So, we need to make a node first and then the `stack` using the `node`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Node Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "We will make a `Node` class and initialize it with `data` and `next` attributes. The `data` attribute will store the `data` of the `node` and the `next` attribute will store the `address` of the `next node`, in this case it will be `None` because we don't have any `next node` yet."

    "\n",
    "### Stack Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "`Linked List` is a `dynamic data structure` that means we don't have to specify the `size` of the `linked list` before using it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Stack is like a `upside down linked list`. The `top` of the `stack` is the `head` of the `linked list` and the `bottom` of the `stack` is the `tail` of the `linked list`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the `head` is the top because we need to be a little clever. If we make the `tail` the `top` then we have to traverse the whole `linked list` to `push` an `item` into the `stack` which has a `time complexity` of `O(n)` but if we make the `head` the `top` then we can `push` an `item` into the `stack` in `O(1)` time.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we will make a `Stack` class and initialize it with a `top` attribute and we don't really nead a `bottom` attribute because we are `pushing` and `popping` from the `top` only. And we will also make a `size` attribute to keep track of the `size` of the `stack`."

    "\n",
    "SO, that's it for `STACK`. Now, let's move on to `QUEUE`.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Queue\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Queue?\n",
    "\n",
    "A `queue` is a `linear data structure` that stores items in a `First-In/First-Out (FIFO)` or `Last-In/Last-Out (LILO)` manner. In `queue`, a new `element` is added at one `end` and an `element` is removed from the `other end` only. The `insert` and `delete` operations are often called `enqueue` and `dequeue`.\n",
    "\n",
    "let's take an example of a `queue of people`. Assume that you have a queue of people waiting in line to buy tickets. The first person you put in the queue is at the front, so it will be the first one to buy the ticket. The last person you put in the queue is at the back, so it will be the last one to buy the ticket. This is exactly how a `queue` works.\n",
    "\n",
    "here is a picture of a `queue`:\n",
    "\n",
    "![queue](https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/s3.studytonight.com/curious/uploads/pictures/1582608897-71449.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we start with an `empty queue`. We can `enqueue` items into the `queue` one by one. Each time we `enqueue` an item, it goes at the `back` of the `queue`. When we `dequeue` an item from the `queue`, we always `dequeue` the `front` item. The `queue` is `empty` when there are no items in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, when we `enqueue` an `item` in the `queue` it's always the last `item` and when we `dequeue` an `item` from the `queue` it's always the first `item` as well. This is why we call it `First-In/First-Out (FIFO)` or `Last-In/Last-Out (LILO)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`stack and queue` very similar `data structures`. And just as we did for `stack`, we will implement `queue` using `array` and `linked list` in this article. But this time we will implement `queue` using `built-in queue` at first and i'll skip the `array` implementation because it's almost the same as `stack` implementation. I leave the `array` implementation for you to implement. It's not that complecated and it's almost the same as `stack` implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Queue Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "A `queue` is an `abstract data type` that supports the following operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `enqueue`: Adds an `item` to the `queue`. If the `queue` is `full`, then it is said to be an `Overflow condition`.\n",
    "- `dequeue`: Removes an `item` from the `queue`. The `items` are `dequeued` in the `same order` in which they are `enqueued`. If the `queue` is `empty`, then it is said to be an `Underflow condition`.\n",
    "- `peek`: Returns the `front` element of the `queue`.\n",
    "- `isEmpty`: Returns `true` if the `queue` is `empty`, else `false`.\n",
    "- `isFull`: Returns `true` if the `queue` is `full`, else `false`.(Not mendaotry for `python` implementation)\n",
    "- `size`: Returns the `size` of the `queue`. (Not mendaotry for `python` implementation)\n",
    "- `clear`: Clears the `queue`. (Not mendaotry for `python` implementation)\n",
