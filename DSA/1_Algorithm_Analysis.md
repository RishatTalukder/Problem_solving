# DSA/Algorithm_Analysis

Simply put, `data structures` are systematics ways of organizing data, while `algorithms` are processes for solving a problem.

To classify some a `data structure` or an `algorithm` as `good`, we must have a precise way of analysing them.

There can be many different ways to do this, one of them is [[Experimental_Studies]].

When an algorithm is implemented we can directly measure it's performance using by recording it's runtime from inside the program.
