    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I said comparatively harder because we need to find out how many `palingdromes` we can make using the `characters` of the `string` and we also have to find out the `length` of the `longest palindrome`. This can look like it's impossible to solve in `O(n)` time complexity. But it's not.\n",

    "If we use a little bit of `math` we can solve this problem in `O(n)` time complexity. Let's see how.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now, we can see that we can make a `palingdrome` of `length` `4` just by using `c` `4` times. And we can also use `d` `2` times to make a `palingdrome` of `length` `2`, if we add `c` `4` times and `d` `2` times we will get a `palingdrome` of `length` `6`.\n",
    "\n",

So, now we see that if we have a `even` `character` we can use all of them to make a `palingdrome`.

We can take `2` of them and make a `palingdrome` of `length` `2`. Again if the length is `5` we can take `4` of them and you can see the pattern. So, we can take `n-1` of the `odd` `characters` and make a `palingdrome` of `length` `n-1`.\n",

    "This is a `medium` difficulty problem. It's a difficult problem because we have to find the `longest palingdrome` in a `string` and if you know about `palingdrome` you know there is a lot of `edge cases` to checking and it's not easy to implement. So, we need to find every pelindrome in the `string` and then we have to find the `longest` one.\n",

    "So, in a normal `palingdrome` problem we loop through the `string` and check if the `string` is a `palingdrome` or not by checking the `left` and `right` `characters` or making a new list then compare the `list` with the `reversed list`.
