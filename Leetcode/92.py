def reverseBetween(self, head: Optional[ListNode], left: int, right: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
    """
    Reverses the order of nodes between the 'left' and 'right' positions (inclusive) in a linked list.

    Args:
        head (Optional[ListNode]): The head of the linked list.
        left (int): The position of the left node to start reversing.
        right (int): The position of the right node to end reversing.

    Returns:
        Optional[ListNode]: The head of the modified linked list.

    Description:
        This function takes the head of a linked list, along with two integers 'left' and 'right', which represent the positions of two nodes in the linked list. The function reverses the order of nodes between the 'left' and 'right' positions (inclusive) and returns the modified linked list.

        The function creates a dummy node with a value of 0 and sets it as the new head of the linked list. It then iterates through the linked list to find the 'left' and 'right' nodes, and keeps track of their previous nodes.

        Once the 'left' and 'right' nodes are found, the function performs the reversal by manipulating the 'next' pointers of the nodes. It uses three pointers: 'prev', 'cur', and 'temp'. 'prev' keeps track of the previous node, 'cur' is used to traverse the linked list, and 'temp' is used to store the next node before updating the 'next' pointer of 'cur'.

        The function swaps the 'next' pointers of the nodes between 'left' and 'right' to reverse their order. Additionally, it updates the 'next' pointers of the previous and next nodes to correctly connect the reversed portion of the linked list.

        Finally, the function returns the head of the modified linked list.

    Complexity Analysis:
        - Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.
        - Space Complexity: O(1), as the function only uses a constant amount of extra space.
