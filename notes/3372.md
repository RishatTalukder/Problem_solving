### 📝 Problem Summary 

> 2 undirected trees are given, `tree1` and `tree2`, each with `n` and `m` nodes respectively and an integer `target`. Goal is to find the maximum number of nodes in `tree2` that can be connected to each node in `tree1` such that the length of the path from any node in `tree1` to its connected node in `tree2` is at most `target`.
> return a list of integers where the `i-th` element is the maximum number of nodes in `tree2` that can be connected to the `i-th` node in `tree1`.

### 🧠 My Thought Process

* **Brute Force Idea:**
  *I thought it was a greedy algorithm problem because If I take the nodes with the maximum degree in `tree2`, I can connect them to the nodes in `tree1` with the maximum degree. However, this approach doesn't work because it doesn't consider the distance constraint and also I cannot reuse nodes in `tree2` for multiple nodes in `tree1`.*

* **Edge Cases:**
    *What if `target` is 0?* 
    *degree of nodes in `tree2` is less than `target`?*
    *No reuse allowed, what does that even mean?*

* **Solution Idea:**
  *I have no idea how to solve this problem, but the I think it can be a path finding algorithm... Let's ask all developers favorite AI assistant, ChatGPT!*

* **Optimized Strategy:**
  *Chat gpt could do it! But after giving up and looking at the solution, I realized my idea was not that bad. I was actually on the right track. So, here is an explanation of the approach totally not written by ChatGPT:*
  
  🧠 **Goal**

    Given two trees (Tree1 and Tree2) and an integer `k`, for each node in **Tree1**, find the **maximum number of nodes** it can reach (including itself) **if you connect it to one node in Tree2**, such that the total number of edges in any path is ≤ `k`.


  ⚙️ **Key Idea**

    * **DFS** is used to count how many nodes are reachable from each node in a tree within a depth limit (`k`).
    * For each node in **Tree1**:

    * Count how many Tree1 nodes it can reach within `k` steps → `count1[i]`.
    * For **Tree2**, we precompute how many nodes each of its nodes can reach within `k-1` steps → `count2`.

    * We subtract 1 because 1 step is used to connect Tree1 and Tree2.
    * Then for each node in Tree1, we **greedily** assume it connects to the \*\*best possible Tree


* **Algorithm Used:**
  e.g. `Depth-First Search (DFS)` to count reachable nodes within a certain depth.

### ⚙️ Code Implementation (Python)

```python {.line-numbers}
class Solution:
    def maxTargetNodes(
        self, edges1: List[List[int]], edges2: List[List[int]], k: int
    ) -> List[int]:

        def dfs(node: int, parent: int, adj: List[List[int]], depth: int) -> int:
            if depth < 0:
                return 0
            count = 1  # include current node
            for neighbor in adj[node]:
                if neighbor == parent:
                    continue
                count += dfs(neighbor, node, adj, depth - 1)
            return count

        def computeReachability(edges: List[List[int]], max_depth: int) -> List[int]:
            n = len(edges) + 1
            adj = [[] for _ in range(n)]
            for u, v in edges:
                adj[u].append(v)
                adj[v].append(u)

            reachable = [0] * n
            for node in range(n):
                reachable[node] = dfs(node, -1, adj, max_depth)
            return reachable

        # Compute reachability in both trees
        count1 = computeReachability(edges1, k)
        count2 = computeReachability(edges2, k - 1)

        # Use the best possible Tree2 node for each Tree1 node
        max_reach_from_tree2 = max(count2)
        return [count1[i] + max_reach_from_tree2 for i in range(len(count1))]

```

### ⏱️ Time & Space Complexity

* **Time:** O(N*K + M*K) 
* **Space:** O(N + M) 

Where `N` is the number of nodes in `tree1` and `M` is the number of nodes in `tree2`.

### 🧩 Key Takeaways

* ✅ What concept or trick did I learn?
    * **DFS for Reachability:** I don't know how greedy algorithms work, but I learned that using DFS to count reachable nodes within a certain depth is a powerful technique.
* 💡 What made this problem tricky?
    * **Understanding Constraints and Hybrid Approach:** The problem was tricky because it combined tree traversal with a distance constraint, and I had to think about how to efficiently count reachable nodes without reusing them.
* 💭 How will I recognize a similar problem in the future?
    * **Look for Tree Traversal with Constraints:** Beware of trees disguised as graphs, especially when distance constraints are involved. If you ever see this animal, don't think, just run(dfs)!
