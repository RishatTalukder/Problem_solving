Absolutely. Here's a *sarcastically honest* version of your LeetCode daily log for **Day 49**, where we celebrate the glorious moment of being mentally suplexed by a trie monster wrapped in DFS spaghetti logic:

## 🧠 Solving LeetCode Until I Become Top 1% — Day `49`

### 🔹 Problem: [Delete Duplicate Folders in System](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-duplicate-folders-in-system/)

**Difficulty:** #Damn
**Tags:** #Trie, #DFS, #StringSerialization, #Hashing, #Tree, #Map, #FolderStructure

---

### 📝 Problem Summary

You're given a list of folder paths in your file system. If two **subtrees (aka folders and all their descendants)** have the **same structure and names**, you must **delete** both of them. Return the folder structure **excluding** the duplicates.

It’s like trying to find evil clone folders in your OS and mercilessly deleting them... *even if they just wanted to live*.

### 🧠 My Thought Process

* **Brute Force Idea:**
  "I can probably use a hashmap to count folders?" — me, before entering the abyss.

* **Optimized Strategy (According to the solution):**
  ❌ Build a Trie.
  ❌ Serialize every subtree using post-order DFS into a weird string-based signature like `a(b(c()))`.
  ❌ Count how many times each signature appears.
  ❌ If any signature appears more than once, nuke the whole subtree from orbit.
  ✅ Return what's left.
  🤯 At this point I had 4 tabs open, a cup of tea, 3 brain cells left, and tears in my eyes.

* **Algorithm Used:**
  `Trie` + `Post-order DFS` + `Signature Hashing` + `My Soul Leaving My Body`

### ⚙️ Code Implementation (Python)

```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Node:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.children = {}
        self.signature = ""

class Solution:
    def deleteDuplicateFolder(self, paths):
        root = Node("")
        for path in paths:
            node = root
            for folder in path:
                if folder not in node.children:
                    node.children[folder] = Node(folder)
                node = node.children[folder]
        
        signature_count = defaultdict(int)

        # Post-order DFS to generate signatures
        def dfs(node):
            if not node.children:
                node.signature = ""
                return ""
            child_signatures = []
            for name, child in sorted(node.children.items()):
                child_signature = dfs(child)
                child_signatures.append(f"{name}({child_signature})")
            node.signature = "".join(child_signatures)
            signature_count[node.signature] += 1
            return node.signature

        dfs(root)

        result = []
        current_path = []

        # Filter out duplicated structures
        def dfs2(node):
            if node.children and signature_count[node.signature] >= 2:
                return
            current_path.append(node.name)
            result.append(current_path.copy())
            for name, child in sorted(node.children.items()):
                dfs2(child)
            current_path.pop()

        for name, child in sorted(root.children.items()):
            dfs2(child)

        return result
```

### ⏱️ Time & Space Complexity

* **Time:** `O(N * L * log L)`
  N = number of paths, L = average folder length. The `log L` is from sorting children.
* **Space:** `O(N * L)`
  Because apparently we love wasting memory with trees, maps, and strings.

### 🧩 Key Takeaways

* ✅ Learned that "folder duplication detection" is a valid algorithmic problem, and not a virus scanner.
* 💡 The trick is to turn a subtree into a unique serial string — like generating a DNA for each subtree — and match them.
* 💭 Next time I see a problem that *smells like a filesystem*, I’ll just light a candle, take a deep breath, and prepare for a DFS + Trie battle.

### 🔁 Reflection (Self-Check)

* [ ] Could I solve this without help?
  ❌ Not even in an alternate timeline where I was raised by Trie monks.
* [ ] Did I write code from scratch?
  ❌ I wrote tears.
* [ ] Did I understand why it works?
  ⚠️ Eventually… after sacrificing an hour and part of my ego.
* [ ] Will I be able to recall this in a week?
  ✅ If I tattoo the signature logic on my hand.
