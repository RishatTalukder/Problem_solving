### 🔹 Problem: [Product Queries of Powers of Two](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-queries-of-powers-of-two/)

**Difficulty:** #Medium
**Tags:** #BitManipulation #PrefixProduct #ModularArithmetic

### 📝 Problem Summary

We are given:

* An integer `n` which can be expressed as a sum of distinct powers of two (from its binary representation).
* Several queries, each `[l, r]`, representing indices in the sorted list of powers-of-two from `n`.

For each query, compute the **product** of powers-of-two in that index range, modulo `10^9 + 7`.

---

### 🧠 My Thought Process

* **Step 1: Understanding the data structure**
  Every `n` can be broken into its binary representation, where each `1` corresponds to a power of two that makes up `n`.
  Example:

  ```
  n = 10 (binary 1010) → powers = [2, 8]
  ```

* **Brute Force Idea:**
  For each query, loop through the subarray `powers[l:r]` and multiply the elements, taking modulo each time.
  This works because:

  * The number of powers is at most 32 (since n ≤ 10^9).
  * The queries are applied on a very small list.

* **Optimized Strategy (not implemented here, but possible):**
  Precompute **prefix products modulo MOD** so that each query can be answered in O(1) time instead of O(length of range).
  Formula:

  ```
  product(l, r) = prefix[r] * inverse(prefix[l-1]) % MOD
  ```

  where `inverse` is computed using modular exponentiation.

* **Algorithm Used:**
  Bit manipulation to extract powers of two + modular multiplication.

### ⚙️ Code Implementation (Python)

```python
class Solution:
    def productQueries(self, n: int, queries: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        powers = []
        i = 0
        # Extract powers of two from n's binary representation
        while (1 << i) <= n:
            if n & (1 << i):
                powers.append(1 << i)
            i += 1
        
        results = []
        for l, r in queries:
            product = 1
            for j in range(l, r + 1):
                product *= powers[j]
            product %= MOD
            results.append(product)
        
        return results
```

### ⏱️ Time & Space Complexity

* **Time:** O(Q × K)

  * Q = number of queries
  * K = length of the queried subarray (at most number of set bits in n ≤ 32)
    → Effectively O(Q) in practice.
* **Space:** O(K) to store the powers.

### 🧩 Key Takeaways

* ✅ Using binary representation is a clean way to extract powers-of-two from an integer.
* 💡 Because the list of powers is tiny (≤ 32), even a brute-force query loop is fast enough.
* 💭 For larger constraints, prefix products + modular inverses are the way to go.
