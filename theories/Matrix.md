## ðŸ“˜ Matrix â€“ A Quick Note

### ðŸ”¹ Definition

A **matrix** is a rectangular arrangement of numbers, symbols, or expressions in rows and columns.

* Each item inside the matrix is called an **element** or **entry**.
* The size of a matrix is written as `m Ã— n` â†’ (m rows, n columns).

Example of a `2 Ã— 3` matrix:

$$
A = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
4 & 5 & 6
\end{bmatrix}
$$

### ðŸ”¹ Types of Matrices

* **Row Matrix**: Only one row (e.g., `[1 2 3]`).
* **Column Matrix**: Only one column.
* **Square Matrix**: Same number of rows and columns.
* **Zero Matrix**: All elements are 0.
* **Identity Matrix (I)**: Square matrix with 1â€™s on the diagonal and 0â€™s elsewhere.
* **Diagonal Matrix**: Non-diagonal elements are 0.

### ðŸ”¹ Operations on Matrices

1. **Addition/Subtraction** â†’ Possible when dimensions are the same.
2. **Scalar Multiplication** â†’ Multiply each element by a number.
3. **Matrix Multiplication** â†’ If `A` is `mÃ—n` and `B` is `nÃ—p`, result = `mÃ—p`.
4. **Transpose (Aáµ€)** â†’ Flip rows into columns.
5. **Determinant & Inverse** â†’ Special properties used in solving equations.

### ðŸ”¹ Applications of Matrices

* Computer graphics (image transformations, 3D modeling).
* Machine Learning (data representation).
* Cryptography.
* Solving systems of linear equations.
* Networks, graphs, and pathfinding algorithms.

âœ… **Key Idea:**
A **matrix** is a compact way to organize and manipulate data, widely used in math, programming, and real-world applications.
