    "### üìù Problem Summary *(in your own words)*\n",
    "\n",
    "> We have to find the difference between the sums of two arrays `num1` and `num2`, with elements from 1 to `n`. `num1` contains numbers not divisible by `m`, and `num2` contains numbers divisible by `m`. The result should be the difference between the sums of `num1` and `num2`.\n",

    "### üß† My Thought Process\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Brute Force Idea:**\n",
    "  Iterate through both arrays, calculate the sums while checking divisibility, and return the difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Time Complexity:** O(n)\n",
    "\n",
    "  > But as this is a math problem, I thought there might be a faster way to solve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Optimized Strategy:**\n",
    "  Since both arrays consist of elements from 1 to `n`, depending on divisibility, there are key properties we can use to calculate the sums directly without iterating through all elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Key Observations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * We can find the sum of `num1` by subtracting the sum of numbers divisible by `m` from the total sum of numbers from 1 to `n`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The count of numbers divisible by `m` in the range 1 to `n` is `n // m`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * To find the sum of numbers divisible by `m`, let‚Äôs say `m = 2`. The numbers divisible by `m` are `2, 4, 6, ..., n` (if `n` is even) or `2, 4, 6, ..., n-1` (if `n` is odd).\n",
    "\n",
    "    * This can be rewritten as `2 * (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k)`, where `k = n // m`.\n",
    "    * So the sum of numbers divisible by `m` is `m * (k * (k + 1)) // 2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The formula for the sum of the first `n` natural numbers is `n * (n + 1) // 2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Therefore, the sum of numbers not divisible by `m` is `total_sum - sum_of_divisible_by_m`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The sum of `num2` is just the sum of numbers divisible by `m`, which we've already calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Algorithm Used:**\n",
    "  **Math** ‚Äî Using properties of arithmetic series to calculate sums directly.\n",
