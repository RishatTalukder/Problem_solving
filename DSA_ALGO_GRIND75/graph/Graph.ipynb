    "`Graphs` are a fundamental `data structure` in computer science. They can be used to represent many things, such as networks, maps, and circuits. Graphs are made up of `vertices` (also called `nodes`) and `edges` that connect them. The edges may be `directed` or `undirected`. In a directed graph, the edges have a direction, while in an undirected graph, the edges do not have a direction."
