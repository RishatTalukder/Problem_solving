    "- What if the `m` is `1` and `n` is `5`?\n",
    "    - If `m` is `1` and `n` is `5` then we have to reverse the whole linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If `m` == `n`, then we don't have to reverse the linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "- if `m` is `0` then we will face an annoying `issue` of not having a `previous node` of the `first node` of the `window`.\n",

    "\n",
    "SO, heres im thinking of solving this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Resolve the `m` is 0 `issue`.\n",
    "    - We need a `dummy` node to solve this `issue` so we will create a `dummy` node and assign it's `next` to the `head` of the linked list. SO that we can have the `previous node` of the `first node` of the `window` always.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Getting the previous node of the `first node` of the `window`.\n",
    "    - We will loop through the linked list until we find the `mth` node of the linked list and store the `previous node` of the `mth` node in a variable called `prev`. The `dummy` node will help us to get the `previous node` of the `mth` node.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you think about it then we really don't need the `after` node of the `window` because we can  just point to that node after reversing the `window` and if it's `null` then we can just point to `null`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Getting the `last node` of the `window`.\n",
    "    - We will loop through the linked list until we find the `nth` node of the linked list and store the `nth` node in a variable called `last`. We will us a for loop to reverse untill we reach the `nth` node.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reversing the `window`.\n",
    "    - SO, same as the `reverse` function we will use a prev, current and next node to reverse the `window`.\n",
    "\n",
    "SO, let's implement it and hope it works.\n"
