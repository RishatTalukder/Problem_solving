    "The time complexity of the `pop_first` method is `O(1)` because we have the `head` pointer which points to the first node of the list. So, we can remove the first node of the list in constant time.\n",

    "This can be streight forward like the `singly linked list`. But we can also do it in reverse in `double linked list`. Which might be better because if we loop through the list from the `head` to the `index`, it will take `O(n)` time. At the same time if we loop through the list from the `tail` to the `index`, it will also take `O(n)` time. But if we loop through the list from the `head` or the `tail` whichever is closer to the `index`, it will take `O(n/2)` time. Which is better than `O(n)`.\n",
    "\n",
